## Features

The table below outlines the features available for this type of connection.

- **Native** - This refers to when a database client connects through a specific protocol, such as an IDE or client libraries.
- **One Off** - This term refers to when a Hoop client performs ad hoc executions through a web app or Hoop CLI.

| Feature | Native | One Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS Termination Proxy | <Icon icon="check" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The local proxy terminates the connection with TLS, enabling the connection with the remote server to be TLS encrypted. |
| Audit | <Icon icon="check" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The gateway stores and audits the queries being issued by the client |
| Data Masking (DLP) | <Icon icon="check" | <Icon icon="check" /> | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically when performing queries in the database. |
| Credentials Offload | <Icon icon="check" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The user authenticates via SSO instead of using database credentials. |
| Interactive Access | <Icon icon="check" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | Interactive access is available when using an IDE or connecting via a terminal for analysis exploration. |

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONNECTION_STRING | env-var | yes | The MongoDB connection string. See https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/ for more details about the proper format. |

```bash
hoop admin create conn mongo --type database/mongodb -a <agent> \
  -e CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/?<options>
```

## How to Use

Start an interactive session and forward the default port (27018) locally.

```bash
hoop connect mongo
```

```
connection: mongo | session: f2e7634a-f4c4-47cd-bee6-48da080e2a23

---------------------mongo-credentials----------------------
 mongodb://noop:noop@127.0.0.1:27018/?directConnection=true
------------------------------------------------------------
```

In the same connection, one-off processes can be executed.

```bash
hoop exec mongo <<EOF
db.movies.insertOne(
  {
    title: "The Favourite",
    genres: [ "Drama", "History" ],
    runtime: 121,
    rated: "R",
    year: 2018,
    directors: [ "Yorgos Lanthimos" ],
    cast: [ "Olivia Colman", "Emma Stone", "Rachel Weisz" ],
    type: "movie"
  }
)
EOF
hoop exec mongo -- --eval 'db.movies.find()'
hoop exec mongo -i 'db.movies.find()'
```
