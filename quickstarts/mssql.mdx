Connecting to Microsoft SQL Server can be done natively using an IDE or any supported client library. Alternatively, you can use the [sqlcmd command line utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility) for one-off executions.

## Features

The table below explains which features are available for this kind of connection.

- **Native** - it's when a database client is connecting via protocol (e.g., IDE, client libraries)
- **One Off -** It's when a hoop client performs ad hoc executions (*e.g.: webapp, hoop cli*)

| Feature | Native | One Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS Termination Proxy | âœ… | âœ… | The local proxy terminates the connection with TLS, enabling the connection with the remote server to be TLS encrypted. |
| Audit | âœ… | âœ… | The gateway store and audit the queries being issued by the client |
| Data Masking (DLP) | ðŸš« | âœ… | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically when performing queries in the database. |
| Credentials Offload | âœ… | âœ… | The user authenticates via SSO instead of using database credentials. |
| Interactive Access | âœ… | âœ… | Interactive access is available when using an IDE or connecting via a terminal to perform analysis exploration. |

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HOST | env-var | yes | The IP or Host of the SQL Server |
| PORT | env-var | yes | The port of the SQL server |
| USER | env-var | yes | The user with access to the instance |
| PASS | env-var | yes | The password with access to the instance |
| DB | env-var | yes | The name of the database to connect (Required when using the connection via the command line). |
| INSECURE | env-var | no | If the connection will ignore the chain of certificates presented by the server. (the connection will be subject to man-in-the-middle attacks if the network is not reliable. By default, this option is set to false) |

### Connection Command

```bash
hoop admin create conn mssql --type database/mssql -a <agent> \
  -e HOST=<host> \
  -e PORT=<port> \
  -e USER=<user> \
  -e PASS=<pass> \
  -e DB=<db>
```

## How to Use

Forward a local port (*default to `1444`*) to connect in the sql server with any client/IDE

```bash
hoop connect mssql
```

```
connection: mssql | session: 5531dc59-febc-4eee-af26-96e0e0de6769

---------------------mssql-credentials----------------------
      host=127.0.0.1 port=1444 user=noop password=noop
------------------------------------------------------------
ready to accept connections!
```

Test it using sqlcmd utility tool.

```bash
sqlcmd -S 127.0.0.1:1444 -Q "SELECT @@VERSION"
```

---

In the same connection, a one-off process can be run as well.

```bash
hoop exec mssql <<EOF
SELECT @@VERSION
GO
EOF
```

```bash
hoop exec mssql -f /tmp/myquery.sql
hoop exec mssql -i 'SELECT @@VERSION'
# pass arguments to sqlcmd
hoop exec mssql -- -s ";" -h -1 -W <<EOF
SELECT * FROM master.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
EOF
```
