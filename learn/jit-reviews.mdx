This plugin allows teams to review commands before execution or allows time-based sessions.

Users who belong to an approval group can approve or revoke commands. A command is only executed when all groups are approved.

## Time-based Sessions (JIT)

When a connection is enabled, the user can interact with the connection based on the requested time.

The command below asks for a 10 minutes access to the connection bash'

```bash
$ hoop connect bash --duration 10m
â£· waiting session to be approved at https://use.hoop.dev/plugins/reviews/73a28154-58...
```

After approval, the user can connect again without prompting for review for 10 minutes.

## One-time Session

One-time reviews happen when the `exec` command is used or when the command is executed from our Web Client.

Example of one-time execution that would trigger review on a configured connection that requires review:

```bash
hoop exec bash -i 'echo "Hello World"'
```

## Configuration

Access the Web Client and navigate to the Reviews area inside "Manage".
