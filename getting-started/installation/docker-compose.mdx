    - macOS
- The following ports will need to be accessible when deployed remotely:
    - 8009: Used by the Hoop Webapp
    - 8010: Hoop gRPC port
    - 8080: Default identity provider (Zitadel)
    - 443: nginx proxy

- Docker version: 20.10.0 or greater

    Run `docker version` to see your Docker version

## TLS

This installation comes with TLS enabled by default using self signed certificates. It will generate the certificates by default on a host volume.

- `hoop/deploy/docker-compose/hoopdata/tls/ca.crt`: the certificate authority (Root CA)
- `hoop/deploy/docker-compose/hoopdata/tls/server.crt`: the server certificate
- `hoop/deploy/docker-compose/hoopdata/tls/server.key`: the server private key

<Tip>
You could use your own certificates, just make sure to add the files in their respective paths. See the section below.
</Tip>

### Let's Encrypt (optional)

This section explains how to issue a valid certificate for your Hoop instance with [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

> This guide requires a valid domain and access to manage it's own DNS.

- Clone the Hoop project into your local machine

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hoophq/hoop.git && cd hoop/deploy/docker-compose
```

- Execute the command below to issue a new certificate and add the **TXT** record in your DNS management system

```sh
YOUR_DOMAIN=
docker run -v ./hoopdata/tls/:/etc/letsencrypt/archive/ \
    --rm -it certbot/certbot \
    -d "*.$YOUR_DOMAIN" \
    --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly \
    --agree-tos \
    --register-unsafely-without-email
```

- Copy the certificates into the tls path

```sh
YOUR_DOMAIN=docker-compose-setup.hoop.dev
cp ./hoopdata/tls/$YOUR_DOMAIN/fullchain1.pem ./hoopdata/tls/ca.crt
cp ./hoopdata/tls/$YOUR_DOMAIN/cert1.pem ./hoopdata/tls/server.crt
cp ./hoopdata/tls/$YOUR_DOMAIN/privkey1.pem ./hoopdata/tls/server.key
```

#### DNS Configuration

In order for the setup to work, make sure to publish the following addresses pointing to the ip address of your machine

- **auth.$YOUR_DOMAIN**
- **$YOUR_DOMAIN**

## Setup and Launch

The setup requires that you specify the host ip address that is reachable inside the docker network. This address is usually displayed in the main machine interface (eth0, en0, etc).

<Tip>
On MacOS and Linux you could list the interfaces with `ifconfig` or `ip addr`.
</Tip>

The default installation uses [Zitadel](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel) as the default identity provider. The bootstrap process takes between 30~60 seconds.

<Tip>
If you're running the setup without a reachable DNS, specify the ip address with the suffix `.nip.io`. This service allows mapping any ip address to a valid DNS.
For example, if your ip address is 192.168.2.20 the public hostname will be `192.168.2.20.nip.io`.
</Tip>

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hoophq/hoop.git && cd hoop/deploy/docker-compose
cat - > .env <<EOF
HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=192.168.15.48.nip.io
EOF
docker-compose up
```

### Custom Identity Provider

<Tip>
Refer to the [SSO documentation](/configure/idp/get-started) for instructions on how to obtain these values from your identity provider.
</Tip>

```sh
cat - > .env <<EOF
HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<host-ip>.nip.io
IDP_ISSUER=
IDP_CLIENT_ID=
IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
IDP_AUDIENCE=
EOF
docker-compose -f docker-compose-custom-idp.yml up
```

---

A success launch will return the logs of the gateway and the agent

```log
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) starting servers
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) starting gateway at 0.0.0.0:8010
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) server transport created, tls=false
(...)
hoop-agent-1    | (...) connected with success to <host-ip>.nip.io:443
```

## Webapp Login

Now, access your instance via `https://<host-ip>.nip.io`

<Tip>
- In case of using self signed certificates, the browser will warn about your connection not being private. Make sure to bypass it and proceed it.

- This warning could appear more than once, because the app will redirect you to `https://auth.<host-ip>.nip.io`

- In case the browser redirect you to `/logout` endpoint, just edit the url by removing this suffix and hit enter.
</Tip>

### Sign In

If everything is configured properly the Sign In page will be displayed.

<Frame>
  <img

  />
</Frame>

1. Type `admin` for the e-mail input and click on Next
2. Type `Password1` for the password input and click on Next
3. Skip the 2-factor authentication information
4. Change the default password and proceed

A successful logon will redirect to the main Webapp's page

## Your First Connection

Let's make sure the setup is working by creating and interacting with a Postgres connection. In the main page click on **Start with a Demo setup**.

Issue a SQL statement to fetch the customers table.

```sql
SELECT email, firstname, phone, region, username FROM customers LIMIT 2;
```

  />
</Frame>

### Connecting your IDE

In this step we'll be connecting into Postgres using your favorite IDE via Hoop.

- Open your terminal
- Install the [Hoop Command Line](/getting-started/cli) in your host machine
- Login via cli

```sh
# configure it only once in your local machine
hoop config create --api-url https://<host-ip>.nip.io --tls-ca path/to/ca.crt
hoop login
```

<Tip>
The `--tls-ca` option is required only when using self signed certificates.
</Tip>

- Connect into the postgres demo connection

```sh
hoop connect <name-of-the-connection>
```

- Use your favorite database IDE and connect with the provided credentials

<Tip>
See our [Quick Start with Postgres](/quickstarts/postgres) for more information on how to interact with it.
</Tip>

## Onboarding Users (Zitadel)

This section explains how to onboarding new users on Zitadel administrative UI.

The login used to authenticate to Hoop is also an admin on Zitadel.

- Go to **https://auth.[host-ip].nip.io**
- Go to **Default Settings** (top right button) and click on `hoophq` organization.

[image]

- Click on **Users** (top menu) > **New** and fill the form to create a new user

<Tip>
Make sure to check the option: **Set Initial Password**. This option does not depend on sending an email which is unavailable for this setup.
</Tip>

  />
</Frame>


### Associate User

This step grants access to the project / application allowing the new user to Sign In on your Hoop instance.

- Click on **Users** (top menu) and select the created user
- Click on **Authorizations** > **New**
- Select the project **hoopdev** and click on Next and then Save.

<Frame>
  <img

  />
</Frame>

Inform the new user's login (`john.doe`) and his password. The user could now authenticate in the Hoop Instance.

## Clean Up

Just stop and remove all containers and volumes

```sh
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm -y
```
