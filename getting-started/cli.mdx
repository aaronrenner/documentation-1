## Overview

The command line allows for administering gateway resources and connecting to remote resources. To begin, you need to configure your gateway instance.

```bash
hoop config create --api-url https://<gateway-url>
```
<small>The configuration is saved at `$HOME/.hoop/config.yaml`</small>

With this configuration in place, you must obtain an access token to interact with the API. The command below will open your browser and redirect you to the identity provider.

```bash
hoop login
```

If you need to clear this configuration, issue the command below.

```bash
hoop config clear
```

<Info>
If you are unsure about the `<gateway-url>`, contact your administrator. In our multi-tenant environment, the login will automatically prompt you with a default URL: https://use.hoop.dev.
</Info>

After logging in, you can interact with connections. There are two methods for this interaction.

### Exec (ad-hoc executions)

The exec command executes ad hoc commands over remote connections. It triggers a command in a remote service, returns the result, and applies all relevant policies and configurations.

```bash
hoop exec myconnection -i '/bin/process-job.sh'
```

### Connect (terminal console)

The 'connect' command allows you to create an interactive session with a remote resource. Any command that can run in a terminal console can be integrated with Hoop. Here are a few examples:

- docker exec
- bash
- ssh
- rails console
- python console
- kubectl exec
- aws ecs execute-command

```bash
hoop connect bash-console
connection: bash-console | session: 53ed53f9-a5f9-45e9-bbf5-becd1f44f41e
root@5601881aa15e:/app#
```

### Connect (TCP)

The connect feature can be used to interact with TCP services such as databases. It can be used with an IDE or any native database client. The port is forwarded locally to the end-user, providing a secure connection to remote services.

```bash
$ hoop connect pg-prod
connection: pg-prod | session: 4619c80f-7166-487c-8c9f-9609e59ae5d6

--------------------postgres-credentials--------------------
      host=127.0.0.1 port=5433 user=noop password=noop
------------------------------------------------------------
ready to accept connections!
```

<Info>
The connection is established through a secure tunnel. The connection is encrypted and authenticated using the user's identity.
</Info>

## Administrator tools

The admin command line tool allows you to manage resources in hoop.dev.

### Login

```bash
hoop login
```

### Get Resources

To view the resources you can get, type `hoop admin get --help`.

```bash
hoop admin get plugins
```

```bash
NAME    SOURCE  PRIORITY    CONNECTIONS     CONFIG
audit   -       0           6               -
dlp     -       0           6               -
```

Some resources return a tabular view. If they aren't available, you can use the `-o json` option. For example:

```bash
hoop admin get reviews -o json |jq .
```

The tabular view might include extra information, such as connections indicating which agent is linked or which plugin is associated with it.

```bash
hoop admin get conn
```

```
NAME                        COMMAND                                 TYPE          AGENT                   STATUS    SECRETS   PLUGINS
postgres-demo               [ "psql" "-A" "-F" "\t" "-P" "pa... ]   database      demo-hoopdev-61242e2c   online    -         (8) audit, dlp, editor, indexer, r...
python-weasel-7602          [ "python3" ]                           application   flyioagent              online    -         (7) audit, dlp, editor, indexer, r...

ruby-on-rails-rat-6429      [ "rails" "runner" "-" ]                application   contoso-macos           offline   -         (7) audit, dlp, editor, indexer, r...
```

To retrieve a single resource

```bash
hoop admin get plugins audit
```

### Creating Resources

To view the resources you can create, type `hoop admin create --help`.

#### Agents

Create an authentication key and start an agent locally.

```bash
export HOOP_KEY=$(hoop admin create agent demo)
hoop start agent
```

List it

```bash
hoop admin get agents
```

#### Connections

The command below establishes a **command-line** connection with bash, which prints 'hello hoop' to the standard output.

The command below requires that you have at least one agent, named `demo`. To interact with it using `hoop exec|connect`, the agent must be deployed.

```bash
# create it
$ hoop admin create conn hello-hoop -a demo -- bash -c 'echo hello hoop'
# interact it
$ hoop exec hello-hoop
hello hoop
```

To create a Postgres connection

```bash
hoop admin create conn pgdemo -a demo --type database/postgres \
    -e HOST=demo-pg-db.ch707rnaizjg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
    -e PASS=dollar-manger-carouse-HEARTED \
    -e USER=demoreadonly \
    -e PORT=5432

# Interact with it
hoop connect pgdemo

# in another terminal
psql -h 0 --port 5433 dellstore -c 'select now()'
```

#### Environment Variables

You could map environment variables to a connection

```bash
$ hoop admin create conn demo-bashenv -a demo -e ENVIRONMENT=prod -- \
    bash -c 'echo environment is $ENVIRONMENT'

# interact with it
$ hoop exec demo-bashenv
environment is prod
```

You could map an environment variables as a file in the filesystem.

```bash
$ hoop admin create conn demo-bashfs -a demo -e filesystem:SECRET_FILE=mybigsecret -- \
    bash -c 'echo $SECRET_FILE; cat $SECRET_FILE'

# Interact with it
$ hoop exec demo-bashfs
/tmp/29837bea-6eb9-4f82-856a-a47a7c9c7654.envfs
mybigsecret
```

Using a base64 value as input to environment variables

```bash
$ hoop admin create conn demo-b64env -a demo -e b64-envvar:MYENV=$(echo val |base64) -- \
    bash -c 'echo $MYENV'

# Interact with it
$ hoop exec demo-b64env
val
```

### Deleting Resources

To see the available resources available to delete, type `hoop admin delete --help`

#### Delete an agent

```bash
hoop admin delete agent demo
```

### Server Info

To see the server information of the gateway

```bash
hoop admin serverinfo
```
