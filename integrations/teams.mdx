## Configuring

1. First, obtain the incoming webhook URL. Refer to [this section of the Microsoft Teams article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1).
2. Log in to your hoop instance and create a plugin that allows access to the webhook dashboard.

```bash
hoop login
hoop admin create plugin webhooks --overwrite
```

<Info>
For self-hosted deployments it requires the Svix webhook provider deployed locally or using their SaaS instance. Refer to the [Svix documentation](/integrations/svix) for more information.
</Info>

Access the webhook provider dashboard.

```bash
hoop admin webhooks-dashboard
```

### Create an Endpoint

Create an endpoint by adding the URL obtained when creating an incoming webhook in the previous step. And select the events that you wish to send.

<Info>
In the advanced section, make sure to **enable the endpoint rate limit and set it to 4 (per second).** This will respect the limitations enforced by the Microsoft Teams service.
</Info>

### Send a Test Event

Go to the Testing tab, select the available event, and click on the **Send Example** button. This event should be received in the configured Teams channel.

In the "Overview" tab, the test with the sent event will be displayed.

## Connections

Now, you can define which connections will send this event based on the plugin configuration. Update or add a new connection to enable this plugin.

```bash
hoop admin create conn bash -a <agent-name> --overwrite \
  --plugin webhooks \
  --plugin review:admin -- bash
```

Interacting with the connection via the webapp or the CLI will trigger an alert indicating that the connection needs to be reviewed. A message will be sent to the Microsoft Teams channel.

```bash
hoop exec bash -i 'ls -l'
```

## Supported Events

- `microsoftteams.review.create`
