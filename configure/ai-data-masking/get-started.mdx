Hoop.dev's AI Data Masking happens at the protocol layer. It's a zero-config DLP policy that masks sensitive data in real-time.

Unlike traditional DLP solutions, hoop.dev's AI Data Masking doesn't require you to set up rules or policies. It masks sensitive data in real-time in the data stream of any connection you set AI Data Masking according to the fields you configure.

After the setup, we automatically give you a bunch of default and most used fields, so you don't need to worry much about that part either. You can remove or add fields as much as you like. To see all fields available, check our [documentation page for all fields supported](/configure/ai-data-masking/fields).

## Set up

<Info>
  You must be on an enterprise plan to have access to the AI Data Masking feature.
</Info>

Create an account at [Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/dlp) and get your credentials.

When installing hoop.dev, you need to set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with your GCP DLP credentials. Hoop.dev uses Google Cloud's DLP at our protocol layer to mask sensitive data in real-time in the data stream of any connection you configure.

## How it works

At the protocol layer when communicating with a database or server, hoop.dev will open the package and communicate with Google Cloud DLP to mask sensitive data in it. This happens in memory and in real-time, so the data is never stored in the database or server in its original form.

## Future support

We plan to expand our support to other DLP providers in the future. If you have a specific provider you would like us to support, [schedule a demo](https://hoop.dev/meet) with us and let us know about it.
